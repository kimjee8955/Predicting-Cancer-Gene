# Predicting-Cancer-Gene
Classification of cancer causing genes

## Note: The report was written in collaboration with Tiffan Feng, Jonathan Martinez, and Kevin Chen but the entire code was written by myself.

In this project, we aimed to create a statistical learning model using a dataset of 3177gene observations and 97 gene related predictors to predict cancer driver genes—Oncogenes (OGs) and Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSGs)—in a test data set of 1363 gene observations.The genes are encoded as the following in the dataset: neutral gene (NG) as 0, OG as 1, and TSG as 2.

This project was a submission for an in-class (Stats 101C-Regression and Data Mining) Kaggle competition. Our team placed 2nd with a Kaggle score of 0.84825, which measures the weighted categorization accuracy. Link to the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ucla-stats101c-lec4?rvi=1
